# Thesis - (Temporary) Database & Code Repository

This repository currently consists of 1 python file and a folder containing my three databases. I originally also wanted to upload the json files I used in Python to transit to csv files, and also add the output csv files I worked with, however all of these files were over 25MB in size and could therefore not be uploaded. I did upload the CVE database - it contains basically the same information, just transferred into an Excel file already. I will either keep using this repository to also distribute the databases as separate files after filing for a DOI on the one where I add them all together, or I will get rid of this repo and transfer the Python file to pastebin!
